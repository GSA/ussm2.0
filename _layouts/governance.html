                    <p>The SSGC is designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director and has the responsibility, in conjunction with OMB offices, to lead the development and implementation of mission support shared services policy across the government.

                    <p>The SSGB is comprised of representatives from the CXO councils and is responsible for making recommendations to OMB on potential sharing opportunities and for advising on the implementation of the designated activities.
